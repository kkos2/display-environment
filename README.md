# KK OS2 Display Runtime environments

This repository acts as the [repository](https://docs.platform.sh/overview/structure.html)
for the platform.sh project used to host a os2display environment.

A running os2display installation consists of a number of components that are
sourced from individual repositories. In order to deploy os2display we need
to pick a revision from each of these repositories to deploy. This is done
via git submodules.
